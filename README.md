- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kunagai
- 👀 I’m interested in video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blueprints and Html and C# and JavaScript and Css and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on super amazing professional 2D or 3D gaming industries but they´ll never accept me because the standards are too high
- 📫 How to reach me, well please don´t reach me, after all... I am still a learning student model
